    "## 1. Problem Definition & Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Selected project track\n",
    "**AI + Automation (LLM + Video Rendering Pipeline)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is built under the **AI + Automation** track. It combines:\n",
    "- **LLM-based legal understanding** (to interpret and structure unstructured judgments)\n",
    "- **Automation workflow orchestration** (to run the pipeline end-to-end)\n",
    "- **Programmatic video rendering** (to generate an explainer video without editing tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "The system takes a **court judgment PDF as the only input**, extracts key legal information, and automatically converts it into a **structured multi-scene explainer video**.  \n",
    "The entire workflow is designed to work:\n",
    "- without manual summarization  \n",
    "- without manual script writing  \n",
    "- without manual video editing  \n",
    "- without requiring technical knowledge from the end user  \n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Clear problem statement\n",
    "Legal judgments are long, technical, and written in a style meant for legal precision, not for quick understanding. Even if a user has the judgment PDF, understanding it requires time and skill to identify and connect important legal components such as:\n",
    "- **facts**  \n",
    "- **legal issues**  \n",
    "- **arguments from both sides**  \n",
    "- **decision and reasoning (ratio)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem solved by this project is:  \n",
    "**How can we automatically convert a judgment PDF into an easy-to-consume, structured multi-scene explainer video, without manual intervention?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this system, users are forced to:\n",
    "- spend hours reading the judgment end-to-end  \n",
    "- rely on scattered online summaries that may be incomplete or inaccurate  \n",
    "- miss the core legal learning due to complexity and time constraints  \n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Real-world relevance and motivation\n",
    "This problem is highly real because judgments are a primary source of legal learning, but they are difficult to consume for most audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who benefits and why this matters:**\n",
    "- **Law students** need fast revision and clarity on case law outcomes and reasoning.  \n",
    "- **Common people** want to understand judgments that affect rights, property, family matters, criminal law, etc.  \n",
    "- **Lawyers and educators** need short explainers for teaching and awareness.  \n",
    "- **Legal creators and platforms** need scalable ways to produce accurate and structured content quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this solution is uniquely valuable:**\n",
    "- Manual legal summarization + video creation is slow and not scalable.  \n",
    "- Traditional notes or summaries do not provide a consistent “story-like” structured output.  \n",
    "- This pipeline converts complex legal text into an explainer format that can be consumed in minutes, making legal content far more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline can directly power **LawStory AI** as a product feature:  \n",
    "**Upload a judgment PDF → receive a multi-scene explainer video output automatically.**\n"

    "## 2. Data Understanding & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Dataset source (public / synthetic / collected / API)\n",
    "This project does not use a fixed dataset like CSV files, labeled training sets, or tabular datasets.  \n",
    "Instead, it uses **live real-world input** in the form of **court judgment PDFs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source of data:**\n",
    "- Collected / user-provided **judgment PDF documents**\n",
    "- Extracted text generated from those PDFs through Make.com scenario processing\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the “data” here is:\n",
    "- **unstructured legal text**\n",
    "- extracted from real court documents\n",
    "- variable in formatting and complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Data loading and exploration\n",
    "The data enters the system through **Make.com** as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Webhook input**  \n",
    "   - receives the judgment PDF URL or file reference  \n",
    "2. **HTTP module**  \n",
    "   - fetches/downloads the judgment PDF  \n",
    "3. **Custom JS module**  \n",
    "   - extracts PDF → plain text  \n",
    "4. The extracted text is passed forward into the AI step (Gemini)\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage acts as a practical “exploration + validation” step where we confirm:\n",
    "- the PDF was successfully fetched  \n",
    "- extracted text is readable and complete  \n",
    "- extracted content includes enough context to explain the case  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key information we specifically require from extracted text:**\n",
    "- court name / bench details (if present)  \n",
    "- case title / parties  \n",
    "- facts of the dispute  \n",
    "- legal issues framed or implied  \n",
    "- arguments of both sides  \n",
    "- final decision and reasoning / ratio  \n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering\n",
    "This project does not involve numeric feature engineering because it is not a classic ML training pipeline.  \n",
    "Instead, it uses **LLM-ready preprocessing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key preprocessing steps:\n",
    "- ensure extracted text is passed as one clean input to Gemini  \n",
    "- reduce formatting noise (line breaks, repeated headers/footers) indirectly via LLM structuring  \n",
    "- enforce structured output in a predictable JSON schema for automation  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important transformation is:  \n",
    "**Judgment PDF → extracted text → structured multi-scene JSON script**\n",
    "\n",
    "The structured script contains for each scene:\n",
    "- narration (voice text / spoken explanation)  \n",
    "- duration_seconds  \n",
    "- visual instructions (what appears on screen)\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. Handling missing values or noise (if applicable)\n",
    "Yes, legal PDFs frequently contain noise or incomplete information, such as:\n",
    "- irregular spacing and line breaks  \n",
    "- repeated headers/footers  \n",
    "- inconsistent formatting across courts  \n",
    "- scanned PDFs where text extraction is weak  \n",
    "- missing headings (facts/issues not clearly labeled)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was handled practically by:\n",
    "- relying on Gemini to generate clean structured JSON output  \n",
    "- ensuring JSON remains valid and parseable in Make  \n",
    "- prompt design that encourages complete explanation even when structure is not explicit\n"
